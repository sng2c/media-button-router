# Introduction #

I used a couple apps while developing media-button-router because the only bluetooth device I have with media buttons is my car stereo.

# Apps #

  * **Android HTTP Media Button** https://market.android.com/details?id=com.norvan.androidhttpmediabutton _Starts up a webserver on your phone that you can connect to simulate button clicks from your desktop_
  * **Media Keys** https://market.android.com/details?id=net.cwfk.ig88.mediakeys _Creates shortcuts on your home screen to simulate media keys. Helps to launch the app. You can't really use it to navigate the list though._
