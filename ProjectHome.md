**NOTE**: _As my commute has changed, I no longer use this app. I am not actively developing this app. All bug fixes and improvements must come from your contributions._

In android, app writers decide what priority they get when receiving media buttons (pause/play, previous, next, etc). This can be frustrating to users if they want to use a different app to handle these button presses on their Bluetooth devices.

This app attempts to alleviate these pains by providing hands-free selection of the app you want to use to handle media buttons through text-to-speech and use of the previous, next, and play buttons for selection.

NOTE: It is likely that there are some music apps that will never work well with this app. [Status of various apps](MusicAppStatus.md)
